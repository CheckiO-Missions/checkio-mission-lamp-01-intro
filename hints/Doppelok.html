  <div class="answer">
    Your task in this mission, as already clear from the condition, is to calculate how long the light bulb was on.
      I will explain a little how to approach the solution: in the list, the time of inclusion and exclusion is given
      gradually (inclusion, exclusion, inclusion, exclusion...), so you can easily divide this list into corresponding
      lists with inclusions and exclusions separately, and then everything is simple - return amount of running time
      in seconds.

    It will be useful for you to read some information about:
    <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/datetime.html'>datetime</a> - the module,
    <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/datastructures.html'>list.index()</a>
    (<a href='https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_index.asp'>example</a> ), and

  <div class="answer">
    First, we will create a list in which we will store the time when the light bulb is turned off.
      This can be done using a regular list slice.
    <pre class="brush: python">
els=[
        datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0 , 0),
        datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10 , 10),
    ]
els_1=els[1::2]
print(els_1)

# output
[datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10 , 10)]
        </pre>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
  <div class="question">
    I don't know what to do anymore. I need a little hint.
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Next, we will add a for loop, in which we will go through our new list. In this loop, we will implement the calculation
      of the time of operation of the light bulb in future.
    <pre class="brush: python">
els=[
        datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0 , 0),
        datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10 , 10),
    ]
els_1=els[1::2]
for i in els_1:
    # do something
        </pre>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
  <div class="question">
    Nothing works. SOS
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Okay, you have to add another variable in which we will store our result. Calculating the operating time is very
      simple, you need to subtract the on time from the off time and then add this difference in seconds to our result.
    <pre class="brush: python">
els=[
        datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0 , 0),
        datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10 , 10),
    ]
els_1=els[1::2]
result = 0
for i in els_1:
    result += int((i-els[els.index(i)-1]).total_seconds())
        </pre>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
  <div class="question">
    I don't want to give up, help!
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    All you have to do is wrap this code in a function expression and return our result.
    <pre class="brush: python">
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List

def sum_light(els: List[datetime]) -> int:
    result=0
    els_1=els[1::2]
    print(1, els_1)
    for i in els_1:
        result += int((i-els[els.index(i)-1]).total_seconds())
    return result
        </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    Okay, okay! That's the spirit!=)
    Here's a one-line version using the zip() function. The logic is the same, only there are not two lists,
      but one with grouped pairs of light bulbs on and off.
    <pre class="brush: python">
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List


def sum_light(els: List[datetime]) -> int:
    return sum([(b - a).total_seconds() for a, b in zip(els[::2], els[1::2])])
        </pre>
  </div>
